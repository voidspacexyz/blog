Those are 3 massive words, that require a clear definition to context of this article. Let me explain my focus on those 3 words.



## 1. Community

In the context of this article I am talking about communities as any group of people, who share a common living area(ex., a village or a settlement or even an educational institute) specifically in developing countries (like India, Indonesia etc.). In the context of this article, I am also assuming India as an example country, partly because this was the country I grew up in, but also India boasts of linguistic, cultural and religious diversity as a part of its narrative.

### **a) Literacy levels**

Most developing countries define a person literate as someone who can read and write any language. This definition is, in my view, a perfect escape for a government to do less for its citizens. In the context of India, the state claims that it consists of a whooping 28% of its 1.8 billion population who are illiterates. Altough the literacy levels have been coming down drastically, they have not been coming as a part of more education, they have rather just been coming from educating only the current generate, and letting the age of the older generation do the rest. There are very few examples to prove otherwise. One such example is the “Adult School” system that is organized in the state of Tamilnadu (by the local government) to boost its literacy levels. These efforts are few, usually not consistently funded., and often handed out to NGO's and private funders.

Being critical of the numbers is one thing, but the question that we need to as is if the definition is fair? Does literacy mean a person's ability to interpret and understand or meaningful literacy? Would the state take the efforts to help with translators if a person can read and write language A, but something is only available in Language B? More such questions emerge.

Even if we have to agree to the definition, the question that remains is, who is excluded? What constitutes the marginalised population? Does literacy have an impact on empowering the community? What impact has literacy had on women or the dalits? Does literacy mean that these sections of the community are heard, hold a position of power or has had a living conditions upgrade? The data says otherwise apart from a few successful examples.

### **b) Generational gap**

It is not a new in all developing countries (I could even assume the developed ones), that generational gap on knowledge, history, and culture is widening. There are a few who are interested and even fewer who are interested to understand and preserve it. The question that remains is, why is historical culture and knowledge so important anyways? If the history was filled with blood of discrimination, is it not fair for us to forget and enter a new bright world? There are more significant reasons for us to preserve and archive what was known. For various reasons. The history as we  know it for most parts, is the history as narrated by the educated, affording population of the country. For the many (atleast in India and most parts of Asia), knowledge, history and events were only transmitted and passed on orally over generations. These were narrated as songs, stories, practices etc. With the current generation only aquaring formal education, a large part of history that the state does not agree with is neglected and omitted. Hyper local history is never a part of curriculum.  The cooperation, conflicts, narratives, ownership or shared history is not important for the growth of the country. This combined with the questions of literacy levels poses an alarming risk on the loss of this oral tradition.

But for those of you who know me, I am not arguing, we have to back to old ways. I am only saying, we agree or disagree, it is crucial to document or archive. Lets argue the usefulness of the knowledge later. But its also important for us to understand, history was and is never just about practices. It is also a representation of everything that happened in the past. How did communities manage finance, what models of trade were included, how were people entertained, why did they follow certain agricultural practices ? The insights into these records, I strongly believe will throw more light.

### **c) Shared spaces**

Communities can never live in solitude. For better or worse, they have always co-existed. Coexistence brings a lot of shared and individual history. Villages are India, were constructed to ensure its caste system (graded inquality) is reflected as a part of living. The last village is always reserved for the population of the bottom most inequality, while the first for the top most. This brings a lot of important aspects. The controlling community always defined the practices of every village below them. This meant, the more down you are, you are forced to follow practices of everyone above you and your own. Thus, shared spaces are stories of shared culture, conflicts, practices and knowledge. So history, atleast in the Indian context, cannot be looked at a story of a single village, but that of everything that connects and interconnects villages. History is nothing but a knowledge graph.

For the context of the blog, I am going into the specifics of other important definitions that will share communities, like gender, caste etc.

# 2. Owned
1. Where is today's current documentation of history and knowledge
2. Who documents
3. Who tells the stories
4. Who is included and who is excluded
5. What do we mean ownership ?
6. Is it practical ?
7. Is it doable ?

# 3. Technology

1. The state of today's technology
	1. Grew up in the 90's and to me every website was an excitment, and today every website is a staple shit
2. Why does the current technology not work for the communities we talk about ?
3. Digital Divide
4. The curse of internet and digital devices
5.

### Is providing internet a better approach ?
1. Cost of internet access if provided by the state  and how can we bear access ?
2. Can we break net neutrality ?

Even if everyone is connected by internet ?


### Still didn't get it ?

Ok, lets take it simple. We all have those hyperlocal apps that we all use to order food like dominos or swiggy . While the app can still work over the internet, every store is free to have its own menu and set its own price. They can choose to share the menu or just do dine in. The app (technology) is only a platform. We are taking this idea to community history and knowledge , and saying every community can run a small piece of software that they control and can access with or without internet, and they choose to share which knowledge or history they want to share with whom.
